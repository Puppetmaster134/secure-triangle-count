= Secure Triangle Counting for Neo4j

This is a User-defined Procedure implementation of the Best Adaptation algorithm from Ding et al.,2021. The algorithm deletes edges from a source graph to bound the graph by input parameter lambda. With a lambda-bounded graph, epsilon differential privacy can be guaranteed easily in returning a triangle count histogram.

== Building

This project uses maven, to build a jar-file with the procedure in this
project, simply package the project with maven:

    mvn clean package

This will produce a jar-file,`target/procedure-template-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`,
that can be deployed in the `plugin` directory of your Neo4j instance.
